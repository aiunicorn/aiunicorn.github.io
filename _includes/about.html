                As an undergraduate student in computer science at the Kean Unbiversity (WKU) in Wenzhou China, I feel lucky and excited to be a Generation Z with computer science as my major and future profession. Fascinated with the power and impact of digital technologies, I've worked on CS projects of a variety of types, including HCI, web, mobile, machine learning, etc. I am particularly interested in AI techniques, which I believe can help keep changing the world to a better and better place.
